Conclusion:

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that is easy to understand and implement. It sorts elements by repeatedly comparing and swapping adjacent pairs until the entire array is sorted. While Bubble Sort is straightforward, it has some limitations compared to other sorting algorithms.

Strengths of Bubble Sort:

1.Easy to understand and implement.
2.It does not require extra memory.
3.Stable Sorting.

Weaknesses of Bubble Sort:

1.Time Complexity.
2.Performance: It is not suitable for sorting large datasets.

Comparison with Other Sorting Algorithms:

Insertion Sort and Selection Sort have similar time complexities, but Bubble Sort often requires more swaps.
Merge Sort is significantly more efficient.

Conclusion:
Bubble Sort is suitable for small datasets and learning purposes due to its simplicity.  Bubble Sort's main drawback is its slow performance for bigger tasks.
